# 🚀 Automated Real-Time Global Market Streaming & Data Engineering Pipeline

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data engineering solution designed to ingest, validate, and transform global market data in real-time. It bridges the gap between raw streaming APIs and curated cloud data warehousing, moving data from AWS Kinesis through Amazon S3 and into Snowflake. The system ensures 100% data integrity for over 2,200 markets across 36 countries, enabling high-precision statistical analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
* **Scalable Architecture**: Build a resilient streaming flow using AWS Kinesis to handle high-velocity market tickers without data loss.
* **Serverless Validation**: Implement a "sniffing" layer via AWS Lambda to ensure data quality before ingestion.
* **In-Warehouse Transformation**: Utilize Snowpark (Python) to execute complex data cleaning directly within Snowflake's elastic engine, avoiding the overhead of external ETL tools.
* **Statistical Verification**: Mathematically prove the pipeline's accuracy by calculating global averages across 3.3 million processed records.

## 📂 Project Structure
* **`lambda_function.py`**: The Python script deployed to AWS Lambda for real-time S3 file inspection and error handling.
* **`snowflake_market_transformation.py`**: A Snowpark Python script containing the core cleaning logic and regex-based numeric casting.
* **`market_analysis_view.sql`**: SQL DDL defining high-performance views for refined analytics.
* **`Datasets/`**: A directory containing raw CSV captures from NASDAQ, Tokyo, Indian, and Toronto exchanges used for testing.

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

### Core Transformation Logic (Snowpark Python)

Key logic components driving the data normalization:
* **Numeric Casting**: Implementation of regexp_replace and replace functions to scrub currency symbols and commas.
* **Shorthand Normalization**: Logic to convert market shorthand ($K, M, B$) into math-ready float values (e.g., $100K \rightarrow 100,000$).
* **Safe Division**: Use of DIVIDE(..., 10^9) logic to handle Billion-scale valuations while preventing null errors.
* **Schema Enforcement**: Automated casting of "General" string types into $FLOAT$ to support statistical modeling.

## 📈 Data Processing & Pipeline Architecture
### Ingestion Layer (AWS)
* **Kinesis Data Firehose**: Captures live API streams and delivers them to a partitioned S3 Data Lake.
* **Partitioned Storage**: Objects are stored in `YYYY/MM/DD/HH` folders, optimizing Snowpipe performance and storage costs.
* **Kinesis Data Streams**: Serves as the high-throughput entry point for raw, real-time market data ingestion.

### Processing Layer (Lambda & Snowpipe)
* **Real-Time Validation**: AWS Lambda triggers on every S3 "Put" event, inspecting headers and sniffing for data types that would break downstream loads.
* **Automated Loading**: Snowflake Snowpipe provides near-zero latency ingestion from S3 into raw landing tables.

### Transformation Layer (Snowflake)
* **Snowpark Execution**: Python code runs directly in the Snowflake warehouse, eliminating the need to move data to an external compute environment.
* **Final Curated Views**: SQL-based views provide a clean, high-performance interface for final statistical reporting.

---
## 🔑 Key Takeaways
* **Handling Schema Drift**: The pipeline successfully managed disparate data formats and header variations across 36 international market sources.
* **Cloud Cost Efficiency**: Implementation of Snowflake Auto-Suspend and Kinesis buffering intervals ensured a professional-grade architecture within a graduate-level budget.
* **Statistical Integrity**: The pipeline verified a global average market price of $2,540,939,966.05, matching expected results across 3.3M+ records with zero precision loss.
